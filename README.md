# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression

This repository demonstrates a supervised machine learning approach using logistic regression to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The dataset comes from Kaggle’s famous [Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), a classic binary classification problem.
